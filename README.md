## Bike Lane Ranking Methodology

Bike lanes are ranked from **Tier 1 (safest)** to **Tier 6 (least safe)** based on infrastructure type and auto volume:

| **Tier** | **Color** | **Description** |
|----------|-----------|------------------|
| **1** | Dark Blue | - Poured Concrete Barrier<br>- Pre-cast Concrete Barrier<br>- Signed Route with Pre-cast Barrier<br>- Mini-jersey Barrier<br>- Bollard Buffer |
| **2** | Light Blue | - Parking Buffer<br>- Paved Multi-Use Recreational Trail<br>- Multi-Use Path |
| **3** | Cyan | - Low Auto Volume Suggested Route<br>- Bicycle Path |
| **4** | Brown | - Paint Buffer Only |
| **5** | Orange | - Unprotected Bike Lane<br>- Medium Auto Volume Suggested Route |
| **6** | Red | - High Auto Volume Signed Route<br>- High Auto Volume Suggested Route<br>- Paved Shoulder |
